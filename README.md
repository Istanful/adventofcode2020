## Usage

Get cracking on a day:

```bash
bin/prepare-day 5 array
```

This will do a couple of things:

- Download the instructions for day 5 into `day5/README.md`.
- Download the puzzle input for day 5, and parse it into an array in `day5/puzzle_input.rb`.
- Create `day5/part_1_solution.rb` and `day5/part_2_solution.rb`.
- Open the instructions for day 5 in the browser.
